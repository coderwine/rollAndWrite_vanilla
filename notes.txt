Progression notes:

5/27
- Able to switch from player 1 to player 2
    - Need to check for player count total and figure how to switch players depending on how many players and what that position looks like.  DONE
    - When swapping player turn, need to clear "counter" so the next player starts at zero.  DONE 
    - When swapping player turn, need to reset background-color of row to default.  DONE
    - Need to "highlight" greatest score value regarding position (1st, 2nd, 3rd).

5/28
Completed:
    - After banking totals, value returns to zero.
    - Able to swap players (4 player) and update the banking total per player position.

Need to Fix:
    - Need to highlight greatest score value. DONE
    - Need to adjust player postition depending for a player count of 1-3.  DONE
    - Player scores not banking to correct position when player count is 1-3. DONE
    - May include a progress bar.
    - Need to allow for "held dice" after each roll.
    - May create an NPC for 1 player games.

5/29
Completed:
    - Player score is banking in the correct position for all game modes (1-4)
    - Highest score (and tied) values are highlighted in green.

Need to Fix:
    - May include a progress bar.
    - Need to allow for "held dice" after each roll.
    - May create an NPC for 1 player games.
    - Need to design for full screen browser.
    - Would like to include the ability for players to insert their names.
    - Deploy to AWS
    - Different roll combos need to reflect their values (ie: 3 of a kind * 100)
        -Score values should be: 
            * three of a kind
            * five of a kind
            * straight
            * full house
            * single counts (1, 5)
            * need to BUST if no value adds to the counter
6/1
WIP: 
    - Currently have the frame of checking against a roll and injecting it into a function to return the desired results.  Parsing through rolls of 3 to return the desired value (value * 100 or 1 * 1000).
        - This frame is easily converted to fives but will need to pass a full house prior to moving into 3's and 5's.
        - Currently able to to store values into a subTotal variable.  Pulling in 6 values into the array and need to correct it so only proper values are calculated.
6/2
WIP:
    - Need to store positions of each dice and their values. 
    - What kind of array methods can I utilize to parse the information and compare for the scoring system?
        - Need to consider when a player "holds" a die value for banking.  

    - Created a secondTest.js to try and build a cleaner versioning that mimicks what is currently in the semi-working build.
    - May need to work inside of the actual file to incorporate the held aspects of the dice and build those "held" items into a score attribute.
