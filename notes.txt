    - Different roll combos need to reflect their values (ie: 3 of a kind * 100)
        -Score values should be: 
            * three of a kind
            * five of a kind
            * straight
            * full house
            * single counts (1, 5)
6/1
WIP: 
    - Currently have the frame of checking against a roll and injecting it into a function to return the desired results.  Parsing through rolls of 3 to return the desired value (value * 100 or 1 * 1000).
        - This frame is easily converted to fives but will need to pass a full house prior to moving into 3's and 5's.
